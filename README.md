# Customer-Churn-Prediction
We create a demographic segmentation model to predict the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period. This model is transferable and can be applied to million scenarios where we have binary outcomes and lots of independent variables. For instance we can build a proper robust model for the following scenarios:

- Should a person be approved for a credit or not? 
- Should a person get a loan or not?

The problem that we are about to deal with is a classification problem. We have several independent variables like the credit score, the balance, the number of products. And based on these independent variables, we are trying to predict which customers are leaving the bank. So basically what we're about to do is a classification problem and artificial neural networks can do a terrific job at doing this, at making that kind of predictions.
